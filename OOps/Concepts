OOPS in Java (Short Points)------

1. Class
-Blueprint of an object, set of rules 
-Contains attributes or variables (data members) and methods


2.Object
-Instance of a class
-Represents real-world entity
-Created using new keyword


3. Encapsulation
-Wrapping data and methods into one unit (class)
-Data hiding using private keyword
-Access through getters and setters


4. Inheritance
-One class acquires properties of another class
-Uses extends keyword   ( parent and child )  drived class.
-Promotes code reusability


5.Polymorphism ---Many behaviours
-One thing, many forms
-Method Overloading (compile-time)
-Method Overriding (run-time)


6. Abstraction
-Hiding implementation, showing only functionality
-Achieved using abstract class and interface


7. Interface
-Fully abstract class
-Uses implements keyword
-Supports multiple inheritance


8 Constructor
-Special method to initialize objects
-Same name as class
-No return type



9. Method
-lock of code that performs a task
-Improves code reusability



10. Access Modifiers
-public, private, protected, default
-Control accessibility
